# Catch-some-apples-game
This is a simple Tkinter game when you need to catch some apples with a basket avoiding bombs and keeping your heart healthy.


Each apple caught gives you 1 point to your score, if your score is 20 you win. However, if your score is less than zero you lose. If your health score is 0 you lose, the default health score always equals to 4 and can't be higher than this even if you catch a lot of hearts.  


P.S. The game development was initially started in the middle of 2022 by my English Student - Makar. I personally significantly modified the game and added a lot of functionality, nevertheless, I do not fully have right to the entire code as it was developed by the student at the beginning.
